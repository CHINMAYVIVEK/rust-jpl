# Governance

rust-jpl is currently a **single-maintainer project**.

## Decision Making

- The maintainer has final decision authority
- Community feedback is strongly encouraged
- Major API changes are discussed via issues

## Future Governance

As the project grows, governance may evolve to include:

- Multiple maintainers
- RFC-style proposals
- Voting on breaking changes
